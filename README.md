# Product and Order Microservice
### This microservice is one of other microservices, that we created for a project that consists of cloning the https://ko-fi.com/ website
### We re-built this website (or at least tried to!) using the microservices architecture.
### You can find the other microservices in my GitHub repositories (https://github.com/YahyaRechaki)
